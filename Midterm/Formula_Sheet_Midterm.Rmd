# Trading  

## Market Orders  

An order that tells your broker to buy or sell a fixed number of shares at the “prevailing” market price.  
• Desirable because execution is fast and certain.  
• Dangerous because price is not guaranteed, especially:  
– in illiquid markets  
– in periods of “market stress”  
– for large orders  
  
Furthermore, the price at which you buy and sell will be slightly different. These prices are guaranteed only if you are fast and your order is small!  

## Limit Orders  

For when you are seeking a better price.  
Guarantees price but not quantity.  
Trade may never occur.  
Price may not turn out to be very good!  

## Order Book  

**Theoretically**, is a record of all outstanding limit order.  
All orders are listed from best to worst from the perspective of a potential counterparty.  
– Orders to buy (that you can sell to) are listed from most to least expensive.  
– Orders to sell (that you can buy from) are listed from least to most expensive.  

**Realisitcally** is some limit orders at a moment in time

On some trading venues, limit orders can be hidden if desired.  
• The order book you see is always in the past.  
• Many limit orders will be cancelled. In some cases they will be cancelled because you want to hit them.  

**Market impact**: For large orders, the price of the first share you trade may be much different from the last.  

## Stop Orders  

A “stop order” is actually a type of market order. A stop order to sell is most common and is called a “stop loss order”.  

• Tells your broker to submit a market order to sell when the bid price 
drops below a set amount.  
• Designed to prevent losses from becoming too large.  
• Since a stop order is a type of market order, price is not guaranteed.  
• In well-functioning markets,price obtained is usually close to stop price.  
• In periods of market stress, price can be much lower.  

Stop Loss vs. Limit Sell Orders:  
• Stop Loss Order: order price is below current price, designed to limit losses  
• Limit Order: order price is (usually) above current price, designed to capture higher gains.  

## Margin  

“Margin” is collateral. It can consist of cash or securities and it is held with your broker.
• It is necessary whenever your investment can lose more than 100% of its value:  
– most derivatives  
– short selling  
– Investing with borrowed funds  
• Margin protects your broker from the possibility of you defaulting.  

Margin Rule:  
If your equity falls below a cutoff value, then you must either deposit more funds (cash or T-bills) or reduce your positions.
